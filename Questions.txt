Questions
----------

* What does fixed client mean? Are clients with their clientid already in the database registered and only those registered clients can use the message passing system?
* Do log-ins and log-outs to the system need to be persisted?


Database Layout
----------------

Message(MessageId, QueueId, SenderId, RecevierId, Timestamp, Message)

Queue(QueueId, Name)

Client(ClientId, Name)


Create Queue:
INSERT INTO Queue VALUES (QueueId, Name);

Delete Queue:
DELETE FROM Queue WHERE QueueId = "<QueueId>";





INSERT INTO Message VALUES (<MessageId>, <QueueId>, <SenderId>, <ReceiverId>, <Timestamp>, <Message>);

SELECT * FROM Messages WHERE ReceiverId != null AND SenderId != '<SenderId>' ORDER BY Timestamp ASC LIMIT 1;
